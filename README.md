Introduction:

Text-based passwords have become the most prominent method of authentication in the digital era. More often than not, there are individuals who either have no knowledge of what constitutes a reliable password, or they may simply have no motivation to create a good one, and are perhaps too ignorant to care if the information they are storing stays secure. It then becomes a form of responsibility for these services to guide and ensure that their users are creating strong and effective passwords. These services predominantly use password strength estimators (or password meters) to do so. These password meters are normally colored-bars that indicate if a given password is strong or weak when creating an account. Most of these password estimators involve very basic policies that either guide or restrict the user through a set of rules or standards, in order to create their password. However, according to Dan Wheelers findings in his article[1], these password meters may not be as reliable or effective as we think. For example, he found that the password qwER43@! (a seemingly convoluted and complex password) is weak according to PayPals password meter, while eBays own meter judged it as strong. Moreover, in the research of de Carnavalet and Mannan [2], they stated that meters from several high-profile web services (e.g., Google, Yahoo!, PayPal) are quite simplistic in nature and bear no indication of any serious efforts from these service providers, to actually
protect their users sensitive information. This is an alarming precedent, since this creates the possibility of an user being led into believing that a password they created is strong, when in reality, this may not be the case. This is a concerning security risk, especially when we consider Mark Burnetts findings [3] that, while online attacks are difficult, there are enough people with enough
weak passwords that they will always yield results. Thus, ineffective password meters could mean potentially easier and/or a higher number of attacks from potential attackers. As such, having a strong and secure password has become as important as ever in our digital age.
